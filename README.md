# Personal website

This is my personal website, a digital CV. I strive for it to be as up to date as possible.

You can reach it here: [vincentlundstrom.com](https://vincentlundstrom.com)

For a more formal, less detailed, but definetely up to date version, visit my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/vincent-lundstrom).

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project, you need to install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploying

Changes commited to the `prod` branch will be automatically built and set live on digital ocean.
